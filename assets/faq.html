<p><b>Q: Can I directly play a .zip ROM without extracting first?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes. The emulator can properly handle zipped ROMs.</p>

<p><b>Q: The emulator can't seem to recognize my .7z ROMs.</b></p>
<p>A: .7z ROMs are simply not supported by the emulator. You have to extract the actual ROM files from it before you can play them on the emulator.</p>

<p><b>Q: I can't press the on-screen D-Pad and buttons at the same time.</b></p>
<p>A: It requires the multi-touch API support that is available only on Android 2.0 and later. And of course, you must have a multi-touch capable screen!</p>
